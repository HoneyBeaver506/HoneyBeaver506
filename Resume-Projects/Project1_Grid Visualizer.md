Project Title: "Interactive Character Grid Data Structure with File Processing"

*Key Points to Highlight:*
Implemented efficient 2D grid data structure with O(1) access patterns
Optimized file I/O operations with chunked reading for large datasets
Built interactive CLI with comprehensive input validation and error handling
Applied memory optimization techniques reducing allocation overhead by pre-sizing containers

Technical Skills Demonstrated:
C++17, STL containers, file I/O, memory management, algorithm design, user interface design
