## Key Features

- **Optimized Data Structure**
  - Custom 2D grid implementation with O(1) access for fast character retrieval and updates.
  - Provides efficient manipulation and navigation across the grid.

- **High-Performance File I/O**
  - Utilizes chunked file reading to efficiently process and load large files.
  - Handles both reading and writing operations with minimal latency.

- **Interactive CLI Application**
  - Intuitive command-line interface for real-time interaction with the grid.
  - Comprehensive input validation and detailed error handling for a robust user experience.

- **Memory Efficiency**
  - Pre-sized containers and advanced memory management reduce allocation overhead.
  - Designed for minimal memory footprint without sacrificing performance.
